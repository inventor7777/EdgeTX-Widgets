This is a modified version of Offer Shmuely's Timer widget for EdgeTX which has been modified to not show a title above the value.

To install, place the main.lua file into a folder called "Timer+" and place that into your radio's WIDGETS folder.
Or, alternatively, simply download the widget pack and place the desired widget folder into your radio's **WIDGETS** folder.
