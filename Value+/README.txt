This is a modified version of Offer Shmuely's Value2 widget for EdgeTX which has been modified to be (in theory) compatible with upcoming versions of EdgeTX (2.11-2.20) and (3.0-3.10)

To install, place the main.lua file into a folder called "Value+" and place that into your radio's WIDGETS folder.
